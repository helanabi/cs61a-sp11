# Description

This repository contains my solutions to Labs, homeworks and projets from the course CS 61A: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs,
taught by Brian Harvey at the University of California at Berkeley in its spring term of 2011.

to quote from the course's material:
> In CS 61A, we are interested in teaching you about programming, not about any par-
> ticular programming language. We consider a series of techniques for controlling program
> complexity, such as functional programming, data abstraction, object-oriented program-
> ming, and query systems. To get past generalities you must have programming practice
> in some particular language, and in this course we use Scheme, a dialect of Lisp. This
> language is particularly well-suited to the organizing ideas we want to teach. Our hope,
> however, is that once you have learned the essence of programming, you will find that
> picking up a new programming language is but a few days’ work.

> Welcome to CS 61A, the world’s best computer science course, because we use the world’s best CS book as
> the textbook. The only thing wrong with this course is that all the rest of the CS courses for the rest of
> your life will seem a little disappointing (and repetitive).
